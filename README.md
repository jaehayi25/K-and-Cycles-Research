# K-and-Cycles-Research
Chemistry- Relationship between Equilibrium Constant and Cycles

users_run() - Based on initial A, B, kf, and kr, the function prints the total number of cycles until the flows are within two percent of each other

set_init_amount() - calculates cycles based on initial A, B, and kf, using a set table of K values
