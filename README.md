# K-and-Cycles-Research
The code was developed by Jaeha Yi (jaehayi1@gmail.com) for a chemistry project with Gyan M. Narayan, Augustin Valles, and Felix Venegas under supervison of Dr. Mahesh Narayan at the University of Texas at El Paso. A manuscript, "Learnings from the relation between convergence to equilibrium and the ratio of the forward and reverse rate-constants in a simple chemical reaction" authored by Gyan M. Narayan, Augustin Valles, Felix Venegas, Jaeha Yi, and Mahesh Narayan, is in preparation for publication.


Code Description for Chemistry Project to find Relationship between Equilibrium Constant and Cycles:
- users_run() - Based on initial A, B, kf, and kr, the function prints the total number of cycles until the flows are within two percent of each other
- set_init_amount() - calculates cycles based on initial A, B, and kf, using a set table of K values
