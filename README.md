# K-and-Cycles-Research
Chemistry- Relationship between Equilibrium Constant and Cycles.

users_run() - Based on initial A, B, kf, and kr, the function prints the total number of cycles until the flows are within two percent of each other

set_init_amount() - calculates cycles based on initial A, B, and kf, using a set table of K values

The Java code was developed by Jaeha Yi for a chemistry project with Gyan M. Narayan, Augustin Valles, and Felix Venegas under supervison of Dr. Mahesh Narayan at the University of Texas at El Paso. A manuscript, "Learnings from the relation between convergence to equilibrium and the ratio of the forward and reverse rate-constants in a simple chemical reaction" authored by Gyan M. Narayan, Augustin Valles, Felix Venegas, Jaeha Yi, and Mahesh Narayan, is in preparation for publication.
