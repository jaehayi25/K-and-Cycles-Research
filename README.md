# K-and-Cycles-Research
The code was developed for a chemistry project to find a relationship between equilibrium constant and cycles under the supervision of Dr. Mahesh Narayan at the University of Texas at El Paso. 

- Title: K-and-Cycles-Research
- Author: Jaeha Yi (jaehayi1@gmail.com)
- Code Description:

  users_run() - Based on initial A, B, kf, and kr, the function prints the total number of cycles until the flows are within two percent of each other.

  set_init_amount() - the function calculates cycles based on initial A, B, and kf, using a set table of K values.
